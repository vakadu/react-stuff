# 🧠 React Deep Dive — Learning + Interview Prep

This repo is my personal React playground for mastering the hardest parts of React — from advanced component patterns to system design and real-world UI challenges.

Each folder focuses on a specific **interview-focused** or **production-level** challenge. Code is kept clean, minimal, and self-contained.
